This local weather app was created in pursuit of the Front-End Developer Certificate from Free Code Camp. It was originally written on CodePen. They included this credit in the readme that came with the exported zip so I'll keep it in for now out of politeness:

     "A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/ckingbailey/pen/KNRYJY."
